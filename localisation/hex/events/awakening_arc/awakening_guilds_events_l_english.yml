She invites you to sit with her and you two spend the whole day talking. Before you know it, the sun is setting.

But first you need...§!\n\nYou don't stop the Chef, as you're getting quite hungry. Maybe it's a good time for a snack."

I live in a hunting camp nearby. Are you from the First Camp?§!\n\nYou start talking. He tells you more about the hunters. It seems their camp is not that far.\n\n§R- Well, it was nice to meet you. Sorry, I really have to go now, -§! he points to the deer. §R- Visit me sometime.§!\n\nHe picks up the animal and walks back into the forest."

Go find your own cave, thief!§!\n\nYou calm the man that you are not interested in his cave. He stands bewildered:\n\n§R- Why?! Don't you know what is there? -§! his eyes sparkle. §R- Treasure!§!\n\nHe proceeds to tell you all about the different kinds of rocks he found inside.

You lose patience - what if he has drowned? Only when you finally rush to help, he gets back to the surface, not that far from the beach.\n\n§R- Scared you, didn't I? -§! he is smiling impishly. §R- I knew it!§!\n\nHe falls down on the sand to drying in the sun.\n\n§R- They call me Seawatcher, -§! he continues. §R- Silly name, I think. But oh well, I'm stuck with it now. What's yours?§!\n\nYou tell him there is no name.\n\n§R- Good. You're free to find your calling then, mate.§!\n\nYou speak more about the sea.
