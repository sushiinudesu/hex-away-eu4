  hex_awakening_random_events.1.d:0 "Randomly triggers an event during Awakening Arc"
  hex_awakening_random_events.1.a:0 "OK"

  hex_awakening_random_events.2.t:0 "Hair Fashion"
  hex_awakening_random_events.2.d:0 "§R- Does it look nice? -§! Needle asks. §R- I had some fabrics left and decided to make them.§!\n\nShe, of course, is talking about the ribbons in her hair. Small and colorful, they sway in the wind. It's kinda mesmerizing.\n\n§R- Maybe it was a bad idea...§!\n\nShe spins around in front of the mirror, making different poses and faces. You can't help but laugh, when eventually she falls onto the ground after hitting one of the stands.\n\n§R- Ow... -§! she touches her knee. §R- Hey! Don't laugh! I swear, you are no help.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.2.a:0 "I think it looks nice on you, Needle"
  hex_awakening_random_events.2.b:0 "I don't really like it"

  hex_awakening_random_events.3.t:0 "Lily Pond"
  hex_awakening_random_events.3.d:0 "While walking through the fields you and Needle stumble upon a pond with lilies. You would have missed it behind tall grass, if not for the Needle to suddenly fall through it.\n\n§R- Look, it's a pond! How pretty!§!\n\nYou reach down to the water and see two swans not that from the shore. Carefully they turn towards you, expecting a treat.\n\n§R- Here, I have some bread, §!- whispers Needle and throws you half of a loaf.\n\nYou pinch small chunks of the bread and give it to the birds. They happily eat everything. In a moment the loaf is gone and both birds lose interest in you.\n\nNeedle helps you stand upon and you continue your journey. After a while she asks:\n\n§R- Let's come here again. You promise?§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.3.a:0 "Sure"
  hex_awakening_random_events.3.b:0 "We'll see"

  hex_awakening_random_events.4.t:0 "A New Pot"
  hex_awakening_random_events.4.d:0 "The pot maker looks tired. He had to talk to Needle for an hour, as she's picking "the right pot" for her house. Neither him, nor Needle know what kind of pot that shall be, yet she keeps searching.\n\n§R- Hey, pot maker! What about this one?§! - she screams from far away.\n\nThe poor man walks slowly in her direction to tell her that she has already asked about this particular pot. Twice. But still repeats everything she wants to know.\n\nYou walk slowly between the rows of pottery. Nothing strikes your fancy, until your eyes pick out one turquoise-colored pot. It's not large, but yet very convenient. Needle would probably like it. On the other hand, she probably wants something more colorful."
  hex_awakening_random_events.4.a:0 "Hey, Needle!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.4.b:0 "I could use this pot"

  hex_awakening_random_events.5.t:0 "The Festival"
  hex_awakening_random_events.5.d:0 "It's Fire season and some artisans decided to take a break, as the heat keeps rising and rising every day. This led to a spontaneous festival with music and dancing.\n\nYou join the celebrations and see a familiar face, dancing in a crowd with others. Needle is spinning in her dress, smiling and laughing, when someone bumps into her by accident.\n\nSuddenly she notices you and waves. Before you wave her back, Needle starts running towards and, without stopping for a second, takes your hand and drags you back towards the dancing.\n\n§R- Let's have fun! -§! she shouts and you lose her in the crowd.\n\nYou dance till midnight, even when most people have already left. The last song you dance alone with Needle, both tired from the celebrations.\n\n§R- I'm hungry, -§! she says, when the music finally stops."
  hex_awakening_random_events.5.a:0 "Me too! Let's go eat!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.5.b:0 "Didn't you eat an hour ago?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.6.t:0 "The Bells"
  hex_awakening_random_events.6.d:0 "As soon as you enter the camp, you hear a weird sound. It's like if something is ringing - a chime that small bells make. You feel like it is just round the corner, so you walk faster to see this oddity.\n\nBehind the corner you see none other than Needle, spinning in her dress.\n\n§R- Oh, hello, my friend! -§! she shouts and runs towards you.\n\nThe bells on her skirt start ringing very loud and you have to close your ears.\n\n§R- Is it too loud? -§! she asks. §R- I thought it was loud too at first, but now I've got used to it. What are you saying? Sorry, I can't hear a thing.§!\n\nYou ask her to look around and see that everyone is as stunned as you are.\n\n§R- Oh, I guess it IS loud. I guess I've added too many bells. Have to fix that later.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.6.a:0 "It still looks great"
  hex_awakening_random_events.6.b:0 "Don't. Move."

  hex_awakening_random_events.7.t:0 "Coffee"
  hex_awakening_random_events.7.d:0 "You stay indoors and sit in front of the window. A dust storm keeps raging outside, so you are happy that there is no need to go out today. But what if it stays tomorrow? You promised to be elsewhere...\n\nSomeone is making coffee, it seems. The aroma spreads around and your head starts spinning. It gets stronger and stronger, until you see a cup in front of you.\n\nWhen you lift your eyes, you see Needle with a coffee pot.\n\n§R- Hi, -§! she says, §R- you look troubled, so I've made some coffee for you.§!\n\nThe drink is a bit burnt, but you know that Needle isn't the best at cooking. Not that she doesn't try - it's just that she loses focus fast.\n\nYou notice that Needle waits for your verdict."
  hex_awakening_random_events.7.a:0 "It's good. Thank you"
  hex_awakening_random_events.7.b:0 "It's kinda bad"

  hex_awakening_random_events.8.t:0 "Windmill"
  hex_awakening_random_events.8.d:0 "Clay is walking around the windmill studying its every brick. He wasn't the one who built it, so he's a little interested in how others work on such an interesting job.\n\n§R- Hm, -§! you hear him mumbling below, as you climb to the top of the mill.\n\nFrom the roof of the building you can see everything - the farm, the fields, the forest. Even a far away camp is visible. The wind is casually rotating blades of the windmill, making a soothing sound.\n\nYou spend the whole evening, enjoying the view. You even see the sunset the way you've never seen it before.\n\n§R- Pretty, -§! says Clay, who has suddenly appeared behind you. §R- Let's go.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.8.a:0 "One more minute"
  hex_awakening_random_events.8.b:0 "Did you want to scare me?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.9.t:0 "Floating Trees"
  hex_awakening_random_events.9.d:0 "You admit it - it's quite fun. You absolutely didn't expect it to be that fun, when Clay asked you to join him on his trip to the woodcutters. You thought it was just going to be a boring meeting over plans or something like that.\n\nOh, how wrong you were! Immediately after you two reached the logging site, a foreman greets you with a big smile. Clay nods and the two, understanding each other without a word being spoken, walk in the direction of the river.\n\nThere you can see a few woodcutters that are ready to show you something. They take a few trees, tie them together and then throw them into the water. One of the woodcutters is able to jump on the logs before they float down the river. He navigates down the stream using a long tree branch and soon is far enough that you can't see him, behind the trees.\n\nWoodcutters prepare the next batch of logs and Clay drags you with him as soon as it's in the water. You don't even know how you end up on the logs - it all happened too fast. But floating is nice, very calm and relaxing.\n\n§R- You try? -§! asks Clay giving the long branch to you."
  hex_awakening_random_events.9.a:0 "I'll give it a shot"
  hex_awakening_random_events.9.b:0 "Better you do it"

  hex_awakening_random_events.10.t:0 "New Home"
  hex_awakening_random_events.10.d:0 "The new house is almost finished. It's simple, but very nice. You would definitely live in it. Most people would, as it's built by Clay and his crew. It took a few days - very little for such a building, but the quality is still good, as always.\n\nAnd... it's done. Clay is the last one to leave the building, with his tools in hand. He wipes the sweat from his forehead and walks towards the group of people who've been watching him for a while.\n\nThe future owners thank Clay for his hard work, giving him a large basket with food as payment. Clay humbly accepts and returns to the camp.\n\n§R- Please, -§! Clay prompts the builders to share.\n\nThey immediately dig in and split everything into portions. Clay waits for the others to eat their fill, only claimimng a small bite of bread for himself."
  hex_awakening_random_events.10.a:0 "Here, I've saved you some..."
  hex_awakening_random_events.10.b:0 "Why do you keep doing that, Clay?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.11.t:0 "At the Foundry"
  hex_awakening_random_events.11.d:0 "It's quite hot inside the cave, but it looks like metalworkers are used to it. You, on the other hand, are suffering. How are you even supposed to work here?\n\nClay is finalizing the details with the workers. He doesn't have much experience with building foundries, so he asks a lot of questions. This is the most talkative you've seen Clay in a while.\n\nSuddenly, the man falls down on the ground and you rush to help him. His head is burning, he's probably overheated. You and the workers bring him out of the cave for fresh air.\n\nHe wakes up as soon as he's cooled down a little.\n\n§R- Thank you, -§! says Clay."
  hex_awakening_random_events.11.a:0 "You need to be careful"
  hex_awakening_random_events.11.b:0 "Did we need to go there?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.12.t:0 "Invisible Paint"
  hex_awakening_random_events.12.d:0 "The builders look at new paint with distrust. It has a weird color and the texture is slimy. No one is brave enough to try it.\n\n§R- Come on, -§! Clay urges them to try.\n\nYou pick one of the buckets and a brush. The paint sticks well enough, but the color is still a bit off.\n\n§R- Give it time, -§! says Clay calmly.\n\nYou and the builders wait till the paint dries up. Surprisingly it completely disappears, as if nothing was painted on the wall before. You look puzzled, but the Clay only smiles and says:\n\n§R- Patience.§!\n\nYou wait. The sun sets and it starts getting dark. Some builders have left, but a few are still waiting. Then, as the lights disappear one by one, you notice that the wall you've painted starts glowing. It shines in a soft green color, quite pleasing to the eye. The builders are pleasantly surprised too and congratulate Clay on his invention."
  hex_awakening_random_events.12.a:0 "It's so pretty!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.12.b:0 "I still don't like the texture"

  hex_awakening_random_events.13.t:0 "Dust Courier"
  hex_awakening_random_events.13.d:0 "§R- So? -§! Clay's face shows no emotion, yet you can see him waiting for your answer with anticipation.\n\nThe task is simple - take the packages and bring them to the other side of the City as soon as possible. Sounds easy, but judging by the weather it won't be. A dust storm is coming and it's pretty cold already. Going outside is a very bad idea.\n\nBut it might work. If you run fast enough, it won't be that cold and you won't be caught by the storm. Hopefully, you can even be back in the evening. Unless, of course, the weather isn't worse by then.\n\nYou agree and Clay makes a satisfied expression:\n\n§R- Here's the package, -§! he says and shows you to the exit.\n\nNo thank you, no goodbye. You are standing outside with the package in your hands and the only thing you can do is run."
  hex_awakening_random_events.13.a:0 "Well, let's run..."
  hex_awakening_random_events.13.b:0 "Oh no, I'm not going anywhere!"

  hex_awakening_random_events.14.t:0 "A Teacher"
  hex_awakening_random_events.14.d:0 "§R- First, you dig a small hole...§!\n\nChef is standing on the field, teaching new workers how to plant seeds. Some of them listen carefully, others are bored. Well, not everyone should be good at this job.\n\nYou return to the garden, where the fruit trees grow. A few of them you planted yourself. Now look how they have grown!\n\n§R- Ah, here you are, -§! you hear Chef enter behind you. §R- These people... I swear, I'd do everything myself if I could. Besides, teaching is not my strong side.§!\n\nYou keep listening to Chef's complaints about new hires and think if he ever thought that way of you, when you just started helping him on the farm. He always explained everything to you and never lost patience.\n\nMaybe it's because there are many people here now? Does Chef have a crowd fright? Who knows.\n\n§R- Okay, I have to go back, -§! says Chef. §R- See if they have managed to do anything right.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.14.a:0 "Good luck"
  hex_awakening_random_events.14.b:0 "Mhm"

  hex_awakening_random_events.15.t:0 "Watering the Plants"
  hex_awakening_random_events.15.d:0 "You walk in a row with other farmers, holding a can of water in your hands. Every plant will get some, nothing will be spared.\n\nThis became a routine for you in the past weeks. Waking up early, walking to the river, bringing water and chatting with everyone. As everybody has different duties during the day, morning is the best time to share news and gossip.\n\nChef himself can be seen chatting with a dozen workers on the other side of the row. People come to him for advice and with questions about farming or cooking.\n\nWhen you reach the end of the field, the water in your can is gone. Same with the others. So you gather around Chef for his final speech.\n\n§R- Have a good day, -§! says Chef to everyone and you go different ways to start your day job."
  hex_awakening_random_events.15.a:0 "It is going to be a good day"
  hex_awakening_random_events.15.b:0 "I want to sleep..."

  hex_awakening_random_events.16.t:0 "Fresh Vegetables"
  hex_awakening_random_events.16.d:0 "Chef enters the hall with a large basket full of vegetables.\n\n§R- Hey! Look at those beauties! Aren't they gorgeous?§!\n\nHe is talking, of course, about the gourds he's holding in his hands. They are quite impressive, you might say. How exactly did they grow that big?\n\n§R- And those pumpkins!§!\n\nOh, what! It is so large! Where did he even find it? You've inspected the pumpkin patch not that long ago and never seen anything this size.\n\n§R- I also took some tomatoes and cabbages...§!\n\nSoon he is making a fresh salad from these ingredients. But you swear you've never seen any of these vegetables grow that big."
  hex_awakening_random_events.16.a:0 "Smells good!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.16.b:0 "Where did you find all these?!"

  hex_awakening_random_events.17.t:0 "Refreshing Drink"
  hex_awakening_random_events.17.d:0 "You decided to watch the animals today thinking they would stay inside in this heat. But no - the cows went out of the barn straight to the river.\n\nSo now you're sitting under a tree, trying to hide from the sun. The animals just lay in the water  near the shore. You swim there too, occasionally, but it never helps for long.\n\nYou notice Chef walking to you from the farm. He holds a pot and some glasses.\n\n§R- You want some water, friend?§!\n\nYou nod and he pours it in one of the glasses. You take a sip, expecting it to be just water from the well. Instead you feel something fresh and cool.\n\n§R- I've added some mint and lime, -§! says Chef. §R- Seems perfect for such weather.§!\n\nHe pours himself a glass too and you spend some time chatting. But soon he needs to go back to the farm."
  hex_awakening_random_events.17.a:0 "The drink was very good"
  hex_awakening_random_events.17.b:0 "You need to go already?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.18.t:0 "Harvest Celebrations"
  hex_awakening_random_events.18.d:0 "As you harvest the last cabbage, the crowd roars. It's time for celebration! No more farm work, except for the animals. So everyone can relax and savor the prizes of their labor.\n\nThe tables are put right on the field and immediately loaded with so many dishes. Chef must have gone crazy making all these. When did he even have time to do that? Stayed up all night?\n\nYou see him sitting at the head of the table, eating and drinking with others. It was a good year of farming, he deserves a bit of rest.\n\nYou decide to dig in - the food is great, as always. No matter what you try, you want to eat more of it. And by the end of the evening your belly is full and you can't fit anything more in it.\n\nThe others seem to have the same issue. Even Chef himself can be seen almost laying on his chair.\n\n§R- I guess, we overdid it this year, -§! laughs Chef and the others join in.\n\nGradually, your belly is feeling better and you think you can eat more. Others have the same idea. By midnight there's nothing left on the table."
  hex_awakening_random_events.18.a:0 "That was amazing"
  hex_awakening_random_events.18.b:0 "I'll never eat again"

  hex_awakening_random_events.19.t:0 "Frozen Fields"
  hex_awakening_random_events.19.d:0 "As you walk through frozen fields, you remember the days you spent farming here. Planting, watering, gathering. The animals you cared for. The people you talked to. The heat, the morning fog.\n\nNow the fields are covered in snow, resting for a season. Dust is floating in the air, making you shiver every time it touches your skin.\n\nIt's best to go inside. There you'll find Chef who is probably cooking something tasty. It's always warm in his kitchen and you bet there are others just like you who decided to visit Chef on this cold day.\n\nYou pick up the pace and soon reach Chef's house. He opens the door himself:\n\n§R- Welcome, friend! Noticed you through the window. Come, join the others. I'm making a raspberry pie. It'll be ready soon. Sit, have some tea while you wait.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.19.a:0 "Thanks"
  hex_awakening_random_events.19.b:0 "So predictable"

  hex_awakening_random_events.20.t:0 "Bird Hunting"
  hex_awakening_random_events.20.d:0 "You walk slowly through the field, holding a bow firmly in your hands. The grass is tall, which makes it even harder to see anything. That's not what you've expected from the first field hunting lesson with the Lion.\n\nHe walks not that far from you. You see his eyes follow the smallest movements in the grass. You would have thought that it was just a wind. But no - Lion is following something, waiting for it to show itself.\n\nAnd here it is - a beautiful pheasant appears from beneath the grass and tries to fly away, but Lion's arrow is faster. The bird falls down and you come closer to inspect it.\n\n§R- You see, -§! says Lion, §R- nothing difficult. You just need a bit of practice. And patience, a lot of it.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.20.a:0 "I'll try!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.20.b:0 "Maybe bird hunting isn't for me"

  hex_awakening_random_events.21.t:0 "Animals at the River"
  hex_awakening_random_events.21.d:0 "Lion stops at the edge of the forest and puts his bow away.\n\n§R- We do not hunt here, -§! he explains.\n\nWhen you come out of the woods you see a river flowing through the fields. It's a peaceful place - countless animals drink from the stream and many young ones are playing in the water. Herbivores and carnivores alike come here to refresh and relax.\n\n§R- We found this place on one of the hunts. It was so idyllic, that we couldn't bring ourselves to harm a single thing. The animals seem to be at peace too. I bet you can even pet them.§!\n\nYou test this theory in practice on a small bear cub that rolls in the grass nearby. The animal is happy and has no fear towards you.\n\nYou spend some time with the animals, but soon Lion calls you back to continue the hunt."
  hex_awakening_random_events.21.a:0 "I'll miss this place"
  hex_awakening_random_events.21.b:0 "That was weird"

  hex_awakening_random_events.22.t:0 "A New Grove"
  hex_awakening_random_events.22.d:0 "The meadow is full of sunlight, as you and Lion walk through it towards the forest. You notice something small in the grass and bend down to see it better. It appears to be a tree that only started growing.\n\n§R- Small, isn't it? For now, but soon it will grow tall and strong, -§! says Lion. §R- Look around - they are everywhere.§!\n\nYou stand up and glance over the grass meadow. Lion's right - small sprouts have appeared all over the field.\n\n§R- One day this will be a forest. And it won't take long. I bet next year we'll be walking through a small grove.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.22.a:0 "Let's come back here again"
  hex_awakening_random_events.22.b:0 "It's just nature"

  hex_awakening_random_events.23.t:0 "Forest Fire"
  hex_awakening_random_events.23.d:0 "You smell it in the air - something is burning. Lion gives a call to stop and everyone freezes in place. Behind the trees you can see some glowing. It's getting brighter and warmer, until you finally see flames cover the distant trees.\n\n§R- Run! -§! shouts Lion and all the hunters rush back.\n\nYou run as fast you can, jumping over fallen trees and through the bushes. Finally you're out of the forest. With the hunters you regroup at a hill nearby, from where you can watch the fire consume the forest.\n\n§R- Damn, -§! says Lion. §R- I've never seen a forest fire that large. I hope it won't reach us - we'd be in big trouble.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.23.a:0 "That was scary"
  hex_awakening_random_events.23.b:0 "I hope it will regrow fast"

  hex_awakening_random_events.24.t:0 "Glowbugs in the Forest"
  hex_awakening_random_events.24.d:0 "The forest at night is dark and dangerous, but you went with Lion anyway. He insisted you join him, so now you two are walking in complete darkness away from the camp. Is it a hunt? Are you hunting something tonight? No, neither you, nor Lion brought bows. You are completely unarmed.\n\n§R- We're almost there! I can see them already! -§! whispers Lion.\n\nYou look in front of you. Yes, there's definitely something in that direction. Some sort of glowing, a soft light, swirling around the trees. When you come closer, you see thousands of bugs flying around.\n\n§R- Beautiful, isn't it? -§! Lion bumps your shoulder. §R- I found it a few days ago by accident. I've been coming here everyday since.§!\n\nThe bugs fly around you in patterns, as if both welcoming and studying you at the same time. You walk beside them, fascinated with the view."
  hex_awakening_random_events.24.a:0 "I love it here"
  hex_awakening_random_events.24.b:0 "Why didn't you tell the others?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.25.t:0 "Fireplace Talks"
  hex_awakening_random_events.25.d:0 "Hunters gather at the fireplace and tell their stories. You listen, sometimes nodding in agreement. Then it's Lion's turn to share.\n\n§R- Well, I don't even know what to tell you. You all have hunted with me, all have seen what I've seen. So, my stories are your stories.§!\n\nHe takes a moment to think.\n\n§R- But that is the point, isn't it? We all hunt together, we all share each other's burdens. I'm happy to know each and every single one of you. I may be the Lion, but you are my pride.§!\n\nHunters start laughing and cheering, someone starts filling up the cups again. Not long brfore they begin toasting."
  hex_awakening_random_events.25.a:0 "Cheers"
  hex_awakening_random_events.25.b:0 "No, I'm not drinking"

  hex_awakening_random_events.26.t:0 "Mining Song"
  hex_awakening_random_events.26.d:0 "The miners work tirelessly inside the caves. The sounds of pickaxes can be heard deep below the surface and form a rhythm that you can't help but follow.\n\nOne of the miners starts humming in tune and soon others join in. The melody creates itself, the only thing missing is the words.\n\nLongbeard comes to the rescue:\n\n§R- Working in the mines till morning\n   With pickaxe in hand\n   We, the miners, must be known by\n   Rulers of the land!§!\n\nLyrics come easy to the bald leader of the group and soon the whole song is finished. You and other miners repeat it a few times, someone writes down the lyrics. "
  hex_awakening_random_events.26.a:0 "It's going to be a hit"
  hex_awakening_random_events.26.b:0 "It's okay, I guess"

  hex_awakening_random_events.27.t:0 "Underground River"
  hex_awakening_random_events.27.d:0 "You and Longbeard come across the river, flowing underground. It has a bit of a glow, probably because of the mushrooms growing nearby.\n\n§R- Fresh, -§! notes Longbeard after tasting the water straight from the stream.\n\nYou follow the river till the exit, where you can see it disappear behind the hills, leading to the Great Forest.\n\n§R- Must be one of Blue River's, -§! says Longbeard.\n\nYou nod and both of you return the same way you came.\n\n§R- Wait, -§! stops Longbeard, §R- let me collect some mushrooms. I think I can cook them for dinner later.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.27.a:0 "Let me help you"
  hex_awakening_random_events.27.b:0 "Are you going to eat them?!"

  hex_awakening_random_events.28.t:0 "A Geode"
  hex_awakening_random_events.28.d:0 "§R- I have found it! -§! you hear Longbeard scream from far away.\n\nHe runs toward the camp with a large rock over his head. It looks gray, like any other stone, but the man is shining with happiness.\n\n§R- I've found the geode!§!\n\nThen you remember last night's bet: the drunken fool promised to find a large geode in less than a day. But he was so drunk, that you doubted he would even remember about it. Yet here he is, holding a stone.\n\n§R- Let's crack it open!§!\n\nLongbeard carefully puts the rock on the ground and takes out a chisel. Slowly he makes small chips until the rock splits in two and everyone can see the red crystals inside.\n\nLongbeard shines even brighter and someone is already bringing him a beer. You pity the miner that lost the bet - now he's got double duty for the next week."
  hex_awakening_random_events.28.a:0 "Good job, Longbeard!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.28.b:0 "Poor miner"

  hex_awakening_random_events.29.t:0 "Lava Chamber"
  hex_awakening_random_events.29.d:0 "You dig your pickaxe into the cave walls again and again, searching for ores. But it's in vain. The only thing you gather is sweat on your forehead, as the temperature keeps rising.\n\nCome to think of it, the stone is very warm to touch. There must be something behind the wall. You keep digging and digging, until finally your pickaxe crushes through the wall and you can finally see what's there.\n\n§R- Woah, -§! you hear Longbeard's voice behind you. §R- You found a lava cave!§!\n\nThrough the hole you can see a river of lava flowing through a cavern. The heat is unbearable.\n\n§R- Let me, -§! asks Longbeard.\n\nHe starts digging until it's possible to enter the cavern. Then he just jumps into the hole and walks closer to lava.\n\n§R- Perfect, just perfect.§!\n\nYou lose sight of him, as he goes further into the cavern."
  hex_awakening_random_events.29.a:0 "Longbeard?"
  hex_awakening_random_events.29.b:0 "Let the fool do what he wants"

  hex_awakening_random_events.30.t:0 "Stars in the Ceiling"
  hex_awakening_random_events.30.d:0 "You walk through the tunnels carefully, listening to the sound wind makes far away. Longbeard asked you to meet him further down the road, without telling you why. You don't know this part of the mines much, so you try following the instructions perfectly.\n\nSoon you see Longbeard standing in the middle of the cave to the right.\n\n§R- Oh, you're here!§!\n\nYou nod and come closer and greet him.\n\n§R- So, how is it?§!\n\nYou don't understand. The cave looks like any other, nothing special about it.\n\n§R- Look above your head! -§! Longbeard laughs.\n\nYou lift your head and see hundreds of shining objects on the ceiling.\n\n§R- Diamonds! -§! confirms the miner. §R- Shall we?§!\n\nYou and Longbeard start picking them one by one and put as much in your pockets as you can."
  hex_awakening_random_events.30.a:0 "This is precious"
  hex_awakening_random_events.30.b:0 "How did you even find it?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.31.t:0 "Stay or Leave"
  hex_awakening_random_events.31.d:0 "The dust is not as present in the mines this season. It's probably one of the best places to wait till the new year comes. So you sit with other miners at the cave entrance and drink beer.\n\nLongbeard sits beside you. He had five cups already, which doesn't make him drunk, only a bit tipsy.\n\n§R- Nasty weather, -§! he says. §R- That's why I love the mines - always warm, always cozy, never as crazy as outside.§!\n\nYou note that there are many good things outside too and you two get to argue why it's not healthy to stay in the caves all the time. Others join in the argument and soon everybody is shouting.\n\nOf course, you all end up drunk and the conversation dies down as none of you seems to be able to speak clearly."
  hex_awakening_random_events.31.a:0 "..."
  hex_awakening_random_events.31.b:0 "..."

  hex_awakening_random_events.32.t:0 "Set Sail"
  hex_awakening_random_events.32.d:0 "You work on the boat with Seawatcher. It is coming up rather nicely, almost finished. You look at Seawatcher as he finishes his work, throws the tools on the sand and jumps back on the ship.\n\n§R- Let's try it! -§! he shouts.\n\nYou aren't sure it's a good idea, but it's pointless to argue with him. So you lower it down on the water, remove the ropes and set sail.\n\nSeawatcher guides the boat well. You drift further and further away from the island. Soon you are already nearing the next one, when Seawatcher decides to turn around.\n\nAt first you hear a snap. Then the mast comes crashing down, breaking the left side of the ship. You nearly avoid it falling directly on you.\n\nWhen you stand up again, you see that Seawatcher is not on the boat anymore. He is swimming in the water near the ship.\n\n§R- I think it's not ready yet, -§! he shouts to you."
  hex_awakening_random_events.32.a:0 "Definitely"
  hex_awakening_random_events.32.b:0 "Are you sure?"

  hex_awakening_random_events.33.t:0 "An Obstacle"
  hex_awakening_random_events.33.d:0 "You guide the boat to the other side of the harbor, after you've left all the cargo you had to deliver. Now it's just to bring the boat back to Seawatcher.\n\nYou decide to take a different route today, just around the other side of one of the islands. It won't hurt to explore a little, right?\n\nAs you sail further you see something green above the water. It's impossible to see from far away, so you guide the ship closer. Until it suddenly stops, as if crashing into the sand.\n\nYou carefully turn it around and decide not to test your luck further, going back to the regular route. Nothing else happens before you reach port.\n\nYou mention the oddity to Seawatcher, as he inspects the ship.\n\n§R- Oh, yeah. I saw it too a few days ago. But there were more than one...§!\n\nHe tells you how he crashed there earlier last week, as the trees were submerged below the surface.\n\n§R- I think the forest is sinking. Maybe it'll be completely underwater tomorrow.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.33.a:0 "Let's check it out later"
  hex_awakening_random_events.33.b:0 "Got it"

  hex_awakening_random_events.34.t:0 "At the Shipyard"
  hex_awakening_random_events.34.d:0 "The work at the shipyard never stops. Even during the night someone seems to be working. You stroll on the beach, looking at future ships.\n\nOn one of them you notice Seawatcher, working with his tools. You shout and he waves you to come aboard.\n\n§R- Nice ship, isn't it? -§! he asks. §R- Been working on it for a few weeks.§!\n\nThe ship is really coming along. It's probably going to be a fast one too.\n\n§R- When it's finished we may take into the Beyond, if you dare.§!\n\nYou think it's too early for that, as the ship is still missing some parts."
  hex_awakening_random_events.34.a:0 "Sure, we can!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.34.b:0 "First you need to finish it"

  hex_awakening_random_events.35.t:0 "Bronze Skin"
  hex_awakening_random_events.35.d:0 "As you walk on the beach you notice a man laying on the sand. It's none other than Seawatcher. You haven't seen the man for a few days, yet here he is just chilling in the sun.\n\nProbably too much chilling - his skin has turned completely bronze. And you know for a fact that not that long ago it was as pale as yours.\n\nYou come closer and push him with your foot a little.\n\n§R- Oh, hey! I was just sleeping here a little...§!\n\nYou ask about the skin and he tells you how he got burned in the sun yesterday.\n\n§R- Totally forgot my clothes on the shore. Spent the whole day barely dressed. But I think I like the color - it kinda suits me.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.35.a:0 "Yeah, it's looking nice"
  hex_awakening_random_events.35.b:0 "Don't forget your clothes next time"

  hex_awakening_random_events.36.t:0 "Black Pearl"
  hex_awakening_random_events.36.d:0 "You follow Seawatcher to a hidden harbor.\n\n§R- A lot of pearls to be found there, -§! he said.\n\nAnd now, as the sun goes down, you doubt that you will find that many in the darkness. The water is nice though, very warm and still. So maybe it won't be a waste of time.\n\nYou dive down after Seawatcher and carefully explore the bottom of the sea. It's so clear here - you can see everything even far away. The pearls, however, are nowhere to be found. You pick a few shells, but they turn up empty. The further you go, the less you find. Until finally you see one that has a pearl in it. A black one.\n\nSeawatcher shows you to go back to the surface.\n\n§R- Bad omen, -§! he says when you're at the beach. §R- You should get rid of it.§!"
  hex_awakening_random_events.36.a:0 "It's probably better to throw it away"
  hex_awakening_random_events.36.b:0 "I'll keep it"

  hex_awakening_random_events.37.t:0 "Ice Fishing"
  hex_awakening_random_events.37.d:0 "The harbor is partially covered in ice during Dust season, so the ships mostly stay on the other side of it, where the warm air still comes from the desert.\n\nOn this side, however, there is almost nothing to do, so many sailors switch jobs for the season. But not Seawatcher.\n\nInstead of doing anything else, the man goes ice fishing every day. It seems like nothing can take him away from the sea, not even nature itself.\n\nYou visit him today at his favorite spot. He is so involved that he doesn't even lift his head, before you stand right next to him.\n\nNo wonder - next moment he jumps and starts reeling the line back to the surface. A large fish is jiggling on the hook, trying to break free. But Seawatcher catches it and throws it into the pile with the other fish.\n\n§R- Do you want to join? -§! he asks."
  hex_awakening_random_events.37.a:0 "Sure, I have time"
  hex_awakening_random_events.37.b:0 "No, I'd rather go someplace warm"
