  hex_awakening_first_events.2.t:0 "Edge of the World"
  hex_awakening_first_events.2.d:0 "§R- One day I decided to go as far away from the Tower as possible. I began my journey before sunrise and started walking in a straight line. As the sun rose behind me, I watched a small forest come alive. Near midday I crossed the river and entered large green pastures. Near dusk the sun was in front of me, almost touching the tip of a large hill that I was climbing.\n\nAs I reached higher and higher, I thought that it'd be a good place to stop for the night. Invigorated, I picked up the pace and soon was at the top. But I was not prepared to see what was behind it.§!\n\nFirst stops for a moment and then continues:\n\n§RJust below the hill there was nothing. Emptiness, absolute darkness. Yet the more I looked the further it was - before my eyes the World kept growing, slowly filling the darkness. I sat on the hill and watched the edge move further and further away, until the night came and I couldn't see it anymore.§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.3.d:0 "§R- The first night was the hardest. I didn't know where to go. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know if it was dangerous to venture far away from the Wall. So I stayed near, clinging to the black stone, waiting for something.\n\nBut nothing happened. And it scared me. "What if nothing will happen? What if I'm here alone?", I thought. The whole night I couldn't fall asleep. My mind was filled with questions I had no answers to.\n\nThen the morning came and caught me off guard. One moment it was dark, the next - bright as day. I looked at the World and it was beautiful. During the panic of the first day I didn't even notice that. Funny, right?§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.3.a:0 "The World really IS beautiful"

  hex_awakening_first_events.4.t:0 "Griffon Encounter"
  hex_awakening_first_events.4.d:0 "§R- I was walking through the fields, when I heard a loud scream. It was coming somewhere from above. I was about to stop and look at the sky, but before I could turn around, something picked me off the ground and brought high above the clouds.§!\n\nA flock of birds passes above the camp.\n\n§R- Yes, you've guessed it right - I was stolen by a griffon. Funny enough, I wasn't scared at all. The beast held me with utmost care in its surprisingly soft but firm grip. All I could do was just watch the scenery change beneath us. First there were fields, then a forest, next we were flying above large hills.\n\nAt last we reached our destination - a large nest sitting on a hillside. There the beast landed and finally set me free. At last I could see my captor in its full glory. A large black griffon, almost twice my height, was sitting in front of me. I knew from the start that it didn't plan on eating me. I was but a toy that it found and brought home.\n\nSo for six days I lived in its nest. Probably I could run away anytime. when the griffon was flying away in search of food. But it wasn't right to abandon a friend. Because that's what we were - friends. It cared for me and I tried to care too.\n\nEventually it was the griffon itself who brought me back home. I don't even know why. Maybe it got bored? Maybe it thought that I wanted to go back? Or maybe it just got scared? I may never know. But I'd love to see it again.§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.5.t:0 "Deer King"
  hex_awakening_first_events.5.d:0 "§R- It was a pretty morning. I remember that I was planning to go to the forest and collect some firewood. But of course, it didn't go as planned. Immediately after entering the forest, I noticed a deer and decided to hunt it. Fortunately I had a bow with me, but as you know I'm not really good at it. I kept missing the target and the deer was running further and further away into the forest. Weirdly it wasn't always too far.\n\nI didn't give it much thought at the time. I reasoned that it was probably a dumb eder and didn't understand I was trying to kill it. Why would I think that an animal was actually luring me deeper into the forest? Soon, however, I ended up in the part of woods I did not recognize. A deer disappeared without a trace. I was alone.\n\nSuddenly a yellow light emerged in front of me. It got brighter and closer, until I could see the features of an animal. It was a deer, but not an ordinary one. It was a Deer King. His shining radiance filled everything around. His massive antlers towered like a mighty oak tree. The animal moved with grace and stopped full three steps before me. It sniffed the air, looked at me with its deep black eyes and then it bowed. Instinctively I bowed back. After that the deer turned around and walked back into the forest.\n\nWhen I looked around, I was standing near my camp again as if I had never left.§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.6.d:0 "§R- You all know about the Blue River that flows nearby. I didn't name it - for me it was just a river. And one time it wasn't even blue - it was green.\n\nI don't know why, but during first Water season it changed color. I noticed that when I came there for a swim, which I decided not to after getting a small burn on my hand.\n\nSince then the river changed color back and forth a few times, sometimes minutes after I got out of it. I never knew why and what caused it, but it suddenly stopped when the next season came around.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.6.a:0 "Did it hurt?"

  hex_awakening_first_events.7.t:0 "Fire Fish"
  hex_awakening_first_events.7.d:0 "§R- One time I caught a really weird fish. When I pulled it out of the water, it was all covered in flames. I left it jumping on the ground for a while. The fish kept gasping and the fire was getting weaker and weaker, until finally it was extinguished.\n\nI was glad it worked and kept fishing. Didn't give much thought about it till the evening, when I sat down near the fire and started cooking. Every other fish gradually turned brown as the flames licked their sides. But not this one - it didn't change a bit. I tried boiling it, but without success. Eventually I had to admit defeat and throw it out. I hope some animal knew more about that fish than I did.§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.8.d:0 "§R- If you've ever been to the desert, you've probably seen large tracks and round caves. This is the work of Giant Worms. And, believe me, they are real. I've seen one with my own eyes.\n\nI was walking through the sands, when suddenly the ground started shaking. I instinctively fell back, only for a giant mouth to appear from beneath the earth in front of me the next moment. I managed to get out of its way in time and it continued to move across the dunes like a snake leaving a long trail behind. I followed it at a distance, studying its scales and movement. But finally it had to go back underground - it speeded up and crashed its head into one of the dunes like it was nothing. Next moment it completely disappeared beneath the sands and I was left alone again.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.8.a:0 "I wonder where it is right now"

  hex_awakening_first_events.9.t:0 "Heartbeat"
  hex_awakening_first_events.9.d:0 "§R- One night I ventured too far into the caves and had to spend the night there. I set up a small camp in a cavern and went to sleep.\n\nBut I couldn't - there was some noise coming from beneath the ground. A constant rhythm, like a beating heart. It echoed through the cavern and grew louder and louder the more I tried to ignore it.\n\nI was laying and thinking where did the sound come from? A waterfall? A steam vent? Then I realized - I was not that far from the Wall. It could be that this heartbeat was coming directly from the Tower. And if so - what could be beating inside it?\n\nDeeply in thought, I fell asleep. In the morning the heartbeat was gone and I would never hear it again.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.9.a:0 "I think it's for the best"

  hex_awakening_first_events.10.t:0 "Invisible"
  hex_awakening_first_events.10.d:0 "§R- Have I told you that once I became invisible for a week? It was such a weird experience!\n\nThe day before I went to sleep at my camp as always. Nothing was out of the ordinary. Yet when I woke up, the first thing I noticed was that I couldn't see my hands. I felt moving them and I could touch one with another - it's just that they weren't there.\n\nI stood up and noticed that I couldn't see my body either. Yet I definitely was standing straight in the middle of my camp. As fast as I could I ran to the river to look at my face. But alas, it was gone too. I was completely invisible.\n\nFor a whole week I stayed like this. It was uncomfortable at first, but then I got used to it. Even hunted some rabbits that couldn't see me. The effect ran off the same way it appeared - after a night of sleep after a regular day. I still check every morning if I'm invisible! Thankfully, it didn't happen anymore.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.10.a:0 "Was it... magic?"

  hex_awakening_first_events.11.t:0 "Fog Beyond"
  hex_awakening_first_events.11.d:0 "§R- If you've ever been to the edge of the City, you have probably peeked into the Beyond - a vast expanse of the World that is yet to be explored. You can see as far as the horizon. But it was not always like that.\n\nWhen I was alone, the Beyond was covered in mist. A wall of thick fog separated it from the City. And what is even more interesting - if you were to go into the fog, it would turn you around and you'd be back here again. So I was trapped between two walls, as if someone didn't want me out yet, before others were to come into the World.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.11.a:0 "I wonder: did it move or disappear?"

  hex_awakening_first_events.12.t:0 "A Cold Day"
  hex_awakening_first_events.12.d:0 "§R- Fire season is usually really hot. I often spend days on the coast and love to swim in the sea. The water is warm, the sand is tickling my feet…\n\nYet I can't help but shiver. All because of one weird day. I woke up early, as I got a bit chilly. Decided to go outside and drink something warm. But I was not prepared for what I saw - the whole World was frozen and snow covered all the land. Well, except for the Tower and the Wall - they still remained obsidian, untouched by sudden frost.\n\nI wore warm clothes and went to the river. For sure it couldn't be frozen, I thought. But when I reached it, I didn't even notice as I walked right above. I followed it to the sea, but the sea was completely shackled too.\n\nWhen the sun rose, snow started to melt. This took me off guard, as I completely forgot that I was standing in the middle of the bay, far away from the shore. I started running as fast as I could, but eventually I fell deep into the water. To my surprise it was as warm as usual. I swam to the surface and when I reached it all the snow was gone and it was hot again, as if nothing happened in the morning.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.12.a:0 "What was that?!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.13.t:0 "Five Fingers"
  hex_awakening_first_events.13.d:0 "§R- It's important to stay in the shade once in a while to cool your head during hot weather. Otherwise you can feel uneasy and pass out. I had to learn it the hard way.\n\nI was working the whole afternoon, not minding the sun shining bright above. I noticed something was wrong when I tried to grab a plank of wood with my hand. To my surprise I had five fingers on it! I couldn't believe my eyes. I looked at the other one and saw five fingers yet again. Suddenly the World started spining and I lost my balance. I fell down onto the ground, powerless and confused.\n\nI don't know how I managed to get myself into the shade, but when I regained consciousness I looked back at my hands. They were fine - each having three absolutely normal fingers. I sighed with relief and decided not to spend that much time in the sun on a hot day anymore.§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.14.t:0 "Liquid Obsidian"
  hex_awakening_first_events.14.d:0 "§R- The Wall is made of Obsidian and from what we've seen it can become liquid to let someone awake. But I once saw an obsidian river that flowed through the fields.\n\nIt came from the valley below and was advancing higher and higher into the hills. I don't know how it managed to float upwards, but that's what I saw. A black liquid river, shining in the late morning sun. It was cold on touch and pretty solid, so I couldn't reach to the bottom as much as I tried. Eventually I saw its tail reach me and then disappear beyond the hills. Never again I saw Obsidian just float wherever it wants, but I still think it I might someday.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.14.a:0 "Maybe we could use it too"

  hex_awakening_first_events.15.d:0 "§R- The days in Void season can be gloomy, but the nights are absolutely stunning. I spent many nights just looking at the stars and enjoying the view.\n\nBut one time the sun didn't rise in the morning. The night continued till breakfast, then midday. Even by the evening there was no sunlight. I heard terrified screams of birds and animals and tried not to panic myself. I waited for the morning through the night. When it finally came I was happy - the bright line was moving across the sky and filling the World with light once more!§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.16.d:0 "§R- One time I went for a swim at night. The sea was glowing and it was quite a pretty sight.\n\nNot waiting for anything I jumped into the water and dived deep to the bottom. There were so many colors down there. Luminescent fishes were floating all around me and I could see clearly the whole reef.\n\nIt was then that I heard the music. Not the kind of we make - a sadder, quieter one. It was coming somewhere from the bottom of the sea. I didn't dare to go that far and just listened as long as I could hold my breath. But alas, I had to swim to the surface and get some air. I tried to do that fast, yet when I dived again there was no song anymore. I waited and swam around, but the mysterious melody didn't come back. Fortunately I still remember it.§!"
  hex_awakening_first_events.16.a:0 "I'd like to hear it"

  hex_awakening_first_events.17.t:0 "Deep Voice"
  hex_awakening_first_events.17.d:0 "§R- For a year I was alone in the World. But I wasn't silent, oh no. I talked - and I talked a lot. First I talked to myself. Next I started talking with animals that I saw in my adventures. I even talked to some hills and plants.\n\nBut sometimes I talked to the Tower. At sunset I sat down on a hill, where I could see it clearly. Then I spoke. Mostly just repeating what I did today. Some days I asked questions. Don't know why I did that - the Tower never answered me.\n\nUntil one evening, when I just sat in silence. There was nothing to say that day and I felt really tired. It was then that I heard a deep voice. At first I didn't recognize the words, as they were too loud. But the Tower repeated - THANK YOU. And then it became silent once more.\n\nWhy did it thank me? I didn't do anything. Maybe all it wanted was some company? Just like I did?§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.18.d:0 "§R- On the last day of the year I sat down at my camp and thought about everything that happened to me. I thought about my Awakening. I thought of every season passing by. It was a long year for me. A lonely year. But I survived, I lived it through.\n\nAt sunset I decided to take a walk back to the Wall, where it all began. To touch the stones that awoke me into this World. I felt deeply nostalgic about the place and kept returning there throughout the year. But now I felt something different.\n\n§!First looks slowly at all the people sitting in front of him.§R\n\nBefore my eyes the Wall started moving, forms appeared in it, shapes of creatures looking just like me. You moved and danced, reaching out of the Wall into the World. Your skin gradually turned from obsidian to white, your hair gained color. The clothes appeared on your bodies to cover from cold.\n\nI looked at you with fascination. It was magical. Finally I was not alone. Finally I could be happy. Finally you were here.§!"

  hex_awakening_first_events.19.d:0 "§R- There was one thing I wanted to tell you personally. The night before you awoke I had a dream. This dream showed me the future. I saw the City grow large. I saw disasters come and go. I saw so many weird things…\n\nAnd I saw you. I don't remember other faces - they changed, shifted one into another. But you, you stayed constant throughout the whole dream. You walked with me and saw all of it with me.\n\nAt some point, I think, we became One. I don't know if I became you or you became me, but instead of two people there was only one.\n\nI woke up soon after and forgot about the dream until I met you again that very same day coming through the Wall. It felt like I was meeting an old friend.\n\nSo tell me, old friend, did you feel it too?§!"
