  hex_city_projects_events.1.d:0 "The final log was put in place and the construction finally ended. You spent so many days building this fort that you could not remember when was the last time you went far away from it. But now, looking at finished work, you were proud.\n\nHunters around you cheered, celebrating the success. Lion himself climbed on one of the towers and shouted:\n\n§R- We did it, hunters! We've built our fort! Others laughed at the idea, but look at it now - here it is, fully built, by our own hands!§!\n\nHe stopped for all the cheering and then continued:\n\n§R- I thank you all for your efforts! This fort will be a home and training grounds for every hunter! You're all welcome to join us and share the glory of the hunt! We are the keepers of the forest!§!"
  hex_city_projects_events.1.a:0 "Yeah!"

  hex_city_projects_events.2.t:0 "First Farm"
  hex_city_projects_events.2.d:0 "Working in the fields was hard. Every day you woke up early to water plants and feed the animals. Sometimes you helped build sheds. Some days you were expanding the fields. There was always something to do on the First Farm.\n\nYou heard a bell sound in the distance and lifted up your head. The sun was setting - the day was almost over. Meaning your work was done for today and you had to go back. But somehow you didn't want to.\n\nYou looked at the farm and saw how much progress was made in just a few months. The fields expanded far and wide, seeded with various kinds of plants. Various buildings appeared near the main one to house farmers and animals alike. There was even a mill not that far away near the river.\n\n§R- Hey, -§! you heard a familiar voice. §R- Admiring the view?§!\n\nYou saw Chef coming to you from the side of the forest. As usual he had a lot of things in his basket.\n\n§R- Magnificent, isn't it? I could never imagine it would grow that big, when I started this farm. Thank you, for all your work - thank you. Come, the food is waiting!§!"
  hex_city_projects_events.2.a:0 "It better be good, Chef!"

  hex_city_projects_events.3.t:0 "White Tower"
  hex_city_projects_events.3.d:0 "Clay stood in front of his tower sizing it up. Wasn't clear if he was happy or not. Other builders waited patiently for the verdict.\n\n§R- It'll do, -§! was all he said.\n\nBuilders started cheering, congratulating each other on the finished project. The architect himself just smiled and immediately buried his nose into the plans again. Didn't take long, before he began mumbling:\n\n§R- We can improve this part... And it would be nice to make some changes here... And here...§!\n\nOthers simply went on celebrating, leaving Clay alone near the tower. But it seems great architect didn't mind it all. He didn't even noticing you calling him a few times."
  hex_city_projects_events.3.a:0 "I'll leave him be for now"

  hex_city_projects_events.4.t:0 "City Mine"
  hex_city_projects_events.4.d:0 "The tunnels were dug, the carts ready - it was the opening day! A personal project of Longbeard, it quickly became a great deal. Previously all the mines were disconnected, separate from each other, with their own tools and crew. Now they were all integrated in one single network, traversing all over the mountains.\n\nOf course, what is a celebration without a feast! Longbeard insisted that there should be lots and lots of alcohol for all the miners and everyone who was willing to come to the opening. And his words were heard loud and clear - no one was sober even before the ceremony.\n\nThe man himself was absolutely drunk too, so the speech had to be read by someone else. Yet it didn't stop him from singing a common miner song:\n\n§R- Down and down into the deep\n    Who knows what we'll find beneath...§!\n\nAnd after that - illegible. With laughter the chief miner was sent to rest in his quarters, deep in the mine itself."
  hex_city_projects_events.4.a:0 "Fill a glass and down some mead!"

  hex_city_projects_events.5.t:0 "Yarn Club"
  hex_city_projects_events.5.d:0 "§R- Oh, how wonderful! Simply wonderful! -§! Needle kept saying, as she ran from room to room in her new shop. §R- I just can't believe my eyes!§!\n\nIt was really a magnificent building, especially compared to her previous place. This one was several times larger and could house smaller shops for other artisans. But the main feature was the stained glass ceiling that lit the rooms with all kinds of shades and colors.\n\nNot that it needed any - all shelves and tables were filled with fabrics, dyes and many different materials that Needle hoarded since the Awakening. Not mentioning an extensive wardrobe packed to the top with extravagant clothes.\n\nBut the most important thing was that Needle was happy."
  hex_city_projects_events.5.a:0 "Maybe she'll make something for me?"

  hex_city_projects_events.6.t:0 "Salt Shipyard"
  hex_city_projects_events.6.d:0 "You looked at the harbor and saw many ships join the celebrations. Sailors from all over the coast came to the island to see the shipyard open. And it was a wonderful sight - each ship had different sails and flags, forming a tapestry of many different colors.\n\nSeawatcher stood beside you and grinned happily:\n\n§R- Look, so many of them have come! I did not expect it would be that many!§!\n\nYou laughed - it puzzled you sometimes how this man, loved by all the sailors, could be that naive. Of course they would come. They would follow even if he told them to go into the Beyond tomorrow.\n\n§R- Hey! Let's go meet some friends of mine! They make amazing octopus balls...§!"
  hex_city_projects_events.6.a:0 "I could eat..."
