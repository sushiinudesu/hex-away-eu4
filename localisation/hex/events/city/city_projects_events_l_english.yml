  hex_city_projects_events.1.d:0 "The final log is put in place and the construction finally ends. You've spent so many days building this fort that you can't remember when was the last time you were far away from it. But now, looking at finished work, you feel proud.\n\nHunters around you cheer, celebrating the success. Lion himself climbs on one of the towers and shouts:\n\n§R- We did it, hunters! We've built our fort! Others laughed at the idea, but look at it now - here it is, fully built, by our own hands!§!\n\nHe stopped for all the cheering and then continued:\n\n§R- I thank you all for your efforts! This fort will be a home and training grounds for every hunter! You're all welcome to join us and share the glory of the hunt! We are the keepers of the forest!§!"
  hex_city_projects_events.1.a:0 "Yeah!"

  hex_city_projects_events.2.t:0 "First Farm"
  hex_city_projects_events.2.d:0 "Working in the fields is hard. Every day you wake up early to water plants and feed the animals. Sometimes you help build sheds. Some days you are expanding the fields. There is always something to do on the First Farm.\n\nYou hear a bell sound in the distance and lift up your head. The sun is setting - the day is almost over. Meaning your work is done for today and you have to go back. But somehow you don't want to.\n\nYou look at the farm and notice how much progress has been made in just a few months. The fields have expanded far and wide, seeded with various kinds of plants. Various buildings have appeared near the main one to house farmers and animals alike. There is even a mill not that far away near the river.\n\n§R- Hey, -§! you hear a familiar voice. §R- Admiring the view?§!\n\nYou see Chef coming to you from the side of the forest. As usual he has a lot of things in his basket.\n\n§R- Magnificent, isn't it? I could never imagine it would grow that big, when I started this farm. Thank you, for all your work - thank you. Come, the food is waiting!§!"
  hex_city_projects_events.2.a:0 "It better be good, Chef!"

  hex_city_projects_events.3.t:0 "White Tower"
  hex_city_projects_events.3.d:0 "Clay stands in front of his tower sizing it up. It isn't clear if he is happy or not. Other builders wait patiently for the verdict.\n\n§R- It'll do, -§! is all he says.\n\nBuilders start cheering, congratulating each other on the finished project. The architect himself just smiles and immediately buries his nose into the plans again. Not so long before he begins mumbling:\n\n§R- We can improve this part... And it would be nice to make some changes here... And here...§!\n\nOthers simply go on celebrating, leaving Clay alone near the tower. But it seems great architect doesn't mind it all. He hasn't even noticed you calling him a few times."
  hex_city_projects_events.3.a:0 "I'll leave him be for now"

  hex_city_projects_events.4.t:0 "City Mine"
  hex_city_projects_events.4.d:0 "The tunnels are dug, the carts are ready - it is the opening day! A personal project of Longbeard, it quickly has become a great deal. Previously all the mines were disconnected, separate from each other, with their own tools and crew. Now they are all integrated in one single network, traversing all over the mountains.\n\nOf course, what is a celebration without a feast! Longbeard insisted that there should be lots and lots of alcohol for all the miners and everyone who is willing to come to the opening. And his words have been heard loud and clear - no one was sober even before the ceremony.\n\nThe man himself is absolutely drunk too, so the speech is read by someone else. Yet it doesn't stop him from singing a common miner song:\n\n§R- Down and down into the deep\n    Who knows what we'll find beneath...§!\n\nAnd after that - illegible. With crowd's laughter the chief miner is sent to rest in his quarters, deep in the mine itself."
  hex_city_projects_events.4.a:0 "Fill a glass and down some mead!"

  hex_city_projects_events.5.t:0 "Yarn Club"
  hex_city_projects_events.5.d:0 "§R- Oh, how wonderful! Simply wonderful! -§! Needle keeps saying, as she runs from room to room in her new shop. §R- I just can't believe my eyes!§!\n\nIt is really a magnificent building, especially compared to her previous place. This one is several times larger and can house smaller shops for other artisans. But the main feature is the stained glass ceiling that lits the rooms with all kinds of shades and colors.\n\nNot that it needs any - all shelves and tables are filled with fabrics, dyes and many different materials that Needle has hoarded since the Awakening. Not mentioning an extensive wardrobe packed to the top with extravagant clothes.\n\nBut the most important thing is that Needle is happy."
  hex_city_projects_events.5.a:0 "Maybe she'll make something for me?"

  hex_city_projects_events.6.t:0 "Salt Shipyard"
  hex_city_projects_events.6.d:0 "You look at the harbor and see many ships join the celebrations. Sailors from all over the coast have come to the island to see the shipyard open. And it is a wonderful sight - each ship has different sails and flags, forming a tapestry of many different colors.\n\nSeawatcher stands beside you and grins happily:\n\n§R- Look, so many of them have come! I did not expect it would be that many!§!\n\nYou laugh - it puzzles you sometimes how this man, loved by all the sailors, can be that naive. Of course they would come. They would follow even if he has told them to go into the Beyond tomorrow.\n\n§R- Hey! Let's go meet some friends of mine! They make amazing octopus balls...§!"
  hex_city_projects_events.6.a:0 "I can eat..."
