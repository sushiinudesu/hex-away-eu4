Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has expressed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] idea for the future of [Root.GetName] - a city for all the Awake to call home. A large settlement all around the Tower that will cater to every need of its citizen. And at its foundation  - a System of Guilds. Everyone will be assigned to a guild depending on their abilities and aspirations. Hopefully this will provide a lot of new jobs and better organization."
