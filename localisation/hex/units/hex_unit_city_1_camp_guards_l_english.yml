  hex_unit_city_1_camp_guardsDESCR:0 "Small camps don't need a lot of protection. Wild beasts are the only danger that they have and a few hunters can usually route an animal back to the wilderness. But with camps growing in size it appears that we need to have some guards to maintain peace between various factions and ease tension when arguements happen."
