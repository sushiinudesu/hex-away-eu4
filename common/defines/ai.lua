-- 	-- How important is morale? We estimate M^1.32 (compared to Discipline's D^2) which we approximate with the following taylor expansion:
-- 	MORALE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_TAYLOR_ORIGIN = 4
-- 	MORALE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW0 = 6.233
-- 	MORALE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW1 = 2.057
-- 	MORALE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW2 = 0.082

-- 	-- How important are damage modifiers that don't affect morale (e.g. Fire damage (received))?
-- 	-- Note: We set the morale exponent to 1.32 vs 2 for discipline (which affects both casualties and morale)
-- 	-- so for consistency the combined exponent of the damage modifiers (dealt and received) should be (2 - 1.32) giving the exponent (2 - 1.32)/2 = 0.34 per modifier.
-- 	-- We estimate X^0.34 (where X=1+mod) with the following taylor expansion:
-- 	DAMAGE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_TAYLOR_ORIGIN = 1
-- 	DAMAGE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW0 = 1
-- 	DAMAGE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW1 = 0.34
-- 	DAMAGE_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW2 = -0.112

-- 	-- Because it is different for each regiment we can't afford to go through the regular code path to look up drill modifiers so we simplify
-- 	-- Taking the 0.34 exponent from above we get:
-- 	-- drill_impact_factor = ( (1+0.1*drill)/(1-0.25*drill) )^0.34 which we estimate with taylor expansion:
-- 	DRILL_STRENGTH_FACTOR_TAYLOR_ORIGIN = 0.5
-- 	DRILL_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW0 = 1.064
-- 	DRILL_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW1 = 0.138
-- 	DRILL_STRENGTH_FACTOR_POW2 = 0.022

-- 	-- How important are combat pips? We think a permanent +1 dice modifier is worth a troop count factor of approximately 17/13 = (7.5+1)/(7.5-1)
-- 	-- But pips only apply sometimes and we cannot afford to compute fractional exponents
-- 	-- So we estimate fire_phase_modifier = COMBAT_PIP_IMPORTANCE ^ ( FIRE_PIP_MULT * ( offensive_fire + defensive_fire ) + MORALE_PIP_MULT * ( offensive_morale + defensive_morale ) )
-- 	-- (and similar for shock)
-- 	COMBAT_PIP_IMPORTANCE = 1.04573 -- = (17/13)^(1/6)
-- 	FIRE_PIP_MULT = 3 -- This means having one of each fire pip applies a modifier of 17/13 to the fire phase estimate as desired (since it's equivalent to +1 dice modifier)
-- 	SHOCK_PIP_MULT = 3 -- Ditto
-- 	MORALE_PIP_MULT = 2 -- Morale pips are counted in both phases but only applies to morale damage which we guesstimate to be worth twice as much as casualties (=2/3 or ~1.32/2 of total)
